His neck was tilted to the side and he never moved it. Everytime he tried he yelped in pain. A vet told us he had messed up his neck sleeping bad. Dogs are more athletic then us and even though there bodies are different dosent mean they cant pinch a nerve or have strained a muscle. These shorts are from a guy who actually cares for the dog. Dogs may not be verbally able to tell you whats wrong but they show you. There neck is tilted weird or they walk funny.

The corner lock make the stick figure tilt or rotate a little thus avoiding all the holes. And when you remove the corner lock the stick figure go back to upright position.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Clue: No hole in the left chest alone.  My assumption is that when he locked and rotated it (inclined to the left), the contraption descended, causing the figure to tilt to the left.

Key is in the lock. It rotates the figure,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"All of you are wrong. The trick here is that the human shaped solid plate that you see is made out of ""Polyamorphate Insulin"". And before someone asks, it is not made out of Insulin but just named after the Scientist who invented the composition. The science here is that this composition is made by a process that involves repeated heating and cooling to create weak spots. When you apply pressure on the weak spot, the entire matter kind of ""jellifies"" while preserving its shape. And for the same reason, if this guy hands it over to you, you would only be able to penetrate it if you hit the weak spot first that is you may have to insert it in the same order he does. So sometimes, additional measures are in place like a slightly differently tipped stick for the hole that corresponds to the weak spot etc (like a key so that it works only when the magician does it).",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In that case i would expect next question to be what do i like to do there or how it looks like, so i would probably choose living room as i can think of several english words for activities one can do there as well as name pieces furniture thats typically in a living room (mind you, you dont even need to describe your own living room, if you want to show off, just make up something that will let you use less common words you know - in my case i have an above average knowledge of art history related terms, so i would probably lie that my living room is full of historical object i could describe using professional words to impress the examinator)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"For any n up to 2^31, the sum of the squares of its digits peaks at 810. Therefore, we can precalculate happy numbers up to 810 and return results for any n by checking its sum of squared digits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did this one back when I didn't know the algorithm   I just ran a loop from i = 0 to 10 and made the square function run inside it  And it was actually accepted lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its 2023 we dont apply to companies that ask these stupid questions,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is pretty inefficient: 1. Why use a set if you know for a fact the item will not be there. You just make the add to the set O(n) (python checks for replicas) instead of O(1) (in a list) 2. Why convert to string and then every single digit to int when you can just % 10 for the digit. This solution will prob wont pass the google interview as its not efficient at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like a good use case for recursion,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not teach people bs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How about using a clean recursion. Haven‚Äôt tested as I‚Äôm on phone.  function recursively(n){  if(parseInt(n)<10&& parseInt(n)==1) return true;  If(parseInt(n) <10) return false;  var i=0; var x=1;  while(i<n.length){ x += parseInt(n[i]) * parseInt(n[i]); i++; }  return recursively(x);  },,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great. Another video in my feed with useless examples that generally will never influence the actual things you'll be working on. Instead of doing these, look up famous libraries and frameworks. Try recreating them, build custom routers, allocation, I/O scheduling, caching. Maybe build a file system. Build something that is outside your typical scope but can be of use to you, so as not to lose motivation. Build something and set yourself a limit on how much memory it has to use, or how few API calls.  There ie a quote - ""Real programming starts when you run out of memory"".  Set yourself constrains and build awesome things without exceeding them. You will quickly start thinking outside the box that is your comfort zone - Which is how we learn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pop all of these values out of your list (or vector if you're cool), then continue to traverse the (now shorter) list.  In the worst case, all of the numbers are unhappy and you'll do it in O(m*n).

"My guess is this:  The liquid inside is two liquids with different densities. When he shakes the cylinder, the liquids mix, creating a mixture that has a density lower than the blue beads, but higher than the white beads. This causes them to sink and float respectively.  When he places the cylider down, the two liquids separate, the more dense one sinking. This liquid is more dense than the blue beads, so they rise. The opposite happens at the top; the less dense liquid is less dense than the white beads, so they sink.   They stabilize at the center because that's the interface of the two liquids. The white beads are more dense than the top liquid, but less dense than the bottom one, and vice versa.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It embodies an unbroken loop, where every point on its circumference is equidistant from the center. This elegant symmetry symbolizes balance, completeness, and infinity. Within the circular form lies a metaphor for life's continuous cycles, where endings blend seamlessly into beginnings. The circle invites contemplation on interconnectedness and the never-ending journey of existence, challenging us to embrace the beauty of impermanence and the infinite possibilities that spiral out from its infinite embrace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bruce Lee is The GOAT.. He could challenged any opponent without fear regardless of their sizes and weight. That's one beast you don't want to challenge. He's truly the pioneer of mixed martials art some 40 years ago. His fighting skills and philosophy inspired many around the world..,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There was no UFC or MMA competition at that time. Karate competition was Point Fighting back then. Chuck Norris was a Karate point fighting champion. Bruce Lee advocated full contact fighting and used Baseball Gloves (there was no MMA gloves during that era) as boxing gloves cannot be used to grapple, grab or catch and body paddings so fighters can use full force and test their skill, power, and strength. That's why many people, including Dana White considered Bruce Lee as Father of MMA. Many top Martial Art fighters including boxers have said Bruce Lee was their inspiration! Tens of thousands of Martial Arts practitioners and Masters who believed in his ability cannot be wrong. Many are still alive who looked up to him. They knew he's the real deal! To know more about his fighting philosophy read 2 books ... Tao of Jeet Kune Do & Bruce Lee's Fighting Method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

He chuckled at me, gave me a thumbs up, and left without any issues.

Went to this charity ball my friends company was hosting. Formal attire. Everyone was super snazzy. Went to the balcony to check out the view and this older gentleman in jeans was outside smoking a cigar. He asked me how the party was and I said it was amazing. We chatted about his grand kids flying in the next day to see him and then we parted ways. An hour later he was dressed in a tux standing on stage thanking everyone for coming to his event! Told my friend who invited me that I talked to him about his grand kids. She told me he only had one daughter and she passed away from cancer a few years back. The ball was for cancer research.

"Reminds of the time I found a man going through my patients file and I started quizing him, thought he was one of my senior doctors (I was new to the department). I got him up to date with our treatment plan then he told me the president said he would assist if we needed any help with tests on this particular patient (it was a tricky case and some expensive tests were required).  So the whole time I'm having this conversation with him, one of the nurses is sending signals to me but I'm horrible at reading signals so I just ignore it till the man leaves. After the man leaves the nurse comes to me and tells me I was talking to the president of the hospital that entire time my spirit left my body",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Nearly the same story happened to me once. I worked for an investment bank, I just came, was new to the company, I was employed as an event manager and I was heading to the conference. I got into the lift together with an old man , he was well-dressed and eager to talk, he was accompanied by another man. Later it turned out that he was his bodyguard. He asked me what company I was working for, whether I liked working for the company and where I studied what education I had, we had a wonderful talk and after that he offered to give me a ride to the conference venue because he was going to the same conference. I happily agreed. When we arrived at the conference , other employees saw me with him they told me: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you know.. it‚Äôs a famous Russian politician, he is from the Russian government‚Ä¶.that was funny, because while I was chatting with him I had a feeling as if he was my old neighbour or somebody I had met before it didn‚Äôt even occur to me that he was famous",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just because someone isn't supposed to be there doesn't mean you need to start off the conversation with a terrible attitude.

It happened at a gas station I worked. Equity founder Peter Munga came to fuel at the station. His mode of payment was visa card which required to be accompanied by ID card (back then it was a requirement). Unfortunately he had not carried his ID card so the pump attendant withheld his car keys since he had already fueled. I had to be called to resolve the matter. Fortunately I recognised him and we sorted the matter with the local equity branch manager. He was very humble,,,,,,,,,,,,,
